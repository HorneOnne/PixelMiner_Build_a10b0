# Pixel Miner (Build_a10b0)
## Overview
As a long-time lover of Minecraft, I always try to work on my own voxel game and it was a lot of fun, also a lot of work though.
I'm still working on this from time to time and plan to add many features like creatures, a crafting system, inventory,...

## Features
- Multithreading world generation/meshing/lighting using Task Parallel Library (TPL).
